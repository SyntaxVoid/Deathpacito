__Deathpacito is a plugin built for Terraria servers running on **[tShock](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock)**.__

## Features
Instantly kill yourself with the `deathpacito` command. 


## Download Link
Download the `Deathpacito.dll` file [here](https://github.com/SyntaxVoid/Deathpacito/releases/latest) and drop it in your `ServerPlugins` folder. Then start your server as you normally would. Make sure you grant the proper Permissions!

## Commands
- `deathpacito`: Instantly kills your character-acito


## Permissions
- `deathpacito.die`: Grants the ability to use the `deathpacito` command-acito.

## Why?
There are some instances where a player with a bad internet connection will appear to others to remain at the spawn point and will be unable to interact with the server. Killing the stuck player will cure them of their stuck-ness and they will be able to interact with the world again when they respawn-acito.

## Issues?
**[Submit any issue here-acito!](https://www.github.com/SyntaxVoid/Deathpacito/issues/new)**
